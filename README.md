# Take Home Project
## Description

Simple service that aggregates patient and exam data. In this project, I utilized Typescript, NodeJS, and Jest to design and implement a system that analyzes a text file with specific commands: it can add a new patient, add or delete an exam record of a patient, and delete a patient record â€”which deletes all exam records associated with a patient identifier. For project completion, Jest was utilized to conduct unit tests on all of the service operations. Additionally, for code clarity and understanding JSDoc was utilized to create easy-to-understand documentation of classes, functions and other miscellaneous part of the service.

## Built With

- Node.js - The runtime environment
- TypeScript - The programming language used
- Jest - The testing framework used
- npm - Dependency Management
- JSDoc - Documentation standard for code clarity.
